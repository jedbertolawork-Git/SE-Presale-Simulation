# 03 — Solution Proposal & Requirements

## Executive Summary

Based on the discovery session, FlowSync’s onboarding friction is directly impacting activation, trial-to-paid conversion, and support costs.

The proposed solution focuses on improving onboarding clarity, increasing visibility into user behaviour, and enabling measurable experimentation — while respecting engineering bandwidth constraints.

The objective is to deliver measurable activation improvements within 6–12 weeks.

## Problem Summary

From discovery, the key issues identified are:

1. Users struggle to complete initial workflow setup.
2. Time-to-first-value is longer than expected.
3. Limited visibility into onboarding drop-off points.
4. High volume of onboarding-related support tickets.
5. Conversion rates have plateaued despite increased marketing spend.

## Success Criteria (Measurable Outcomes)

- +10–15% increase in activation rate
- -20% reduction in onboarding-related support tickets
- +5–8% increase in trial-to-paid conversion
- Time-to-first-value reduced by 25–30%
- Measurable results within 3 months

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1 — Visibility & Instrumentation (Weeks 1–3)

Objective: Understand exactly where friction occurs.

Deliverables:
- Event tracking for onboarding steps
- Funnel analytics dashboard
- Drop-off point identification
- Baseline metrics documentation

Requirements:
- Access to analytics tooling
- Engineering support for event instrumentation
- Agreement on activation definition

---

### Phase 2 — UX Optimisation (Weeks 3–8)

Objective: Reduce friction and guide users to first value.

Deliverables:
- Guided onboarding checklist
- Contextual tooltips & in-app guidance
- Simplified initial workflow template
- Clear progress indicators

Requirements:
- UX design alignment
- Frontend development capacity
- Internal QA support

---

### Phase 3 — Experimentation & Optimisation (Weeks 8–12)

Objective: Validate improvements and optimise impact.

Deliverables:
- A/B testing framework for onboarding variants
- Conversion comparison reporting
- Executive performance dashboard
- Iterative improvements based on data

Requirements:
- Experimentation tooling
- Data analysis support
- Stakeholder alignment on testing duration

---

## Technical Considerations

- Must integrate with existing analytics stack
- Ensure GDPR and data privacy compliance
- Avoid heavy backend refactoring
- Prioritise lightweight, modular improvements
- Maintain performance during instrumentation

---

## Risks & Mitigation

Risk: Limited engineering bandwidth  
Mitigation: Phased rollout with prioritised impact areas

Risk: Poor adoption of new onboarding features  
Mitigation: Incremental release with performance monitoring

Risk: Inconclusive A/B test results  
Mitigation: Predefined statistical thresholds and test duration

---

## What We Require from FlowSync

- Clear definition of activation
- Access to onboarding analytics data
- Engineering support for instrumentation
- Executive alignment on KPIs
- Timeline agreement (6–12 weeks)

---

## Why This Approach Works

This solution:

- Focuses on measurable outcomes
- Minimises engineering disruption
- Prioritises high-impact UX improvements
- Aligns product improvements directly with revenue growth
- Enables data-driven decision-making going forward

The result is not just improved onboarding — but a repeatable optimisation framework for long-term growth.
