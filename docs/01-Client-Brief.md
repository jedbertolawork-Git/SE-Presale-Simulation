# 01 — Client Brief

## Client Overview

**Company Name (Fictional):** FlowSync  
**Industry:** B2B SaaS – Workflow & Process Automation  
**Company Size:** ~220 employees  
**Customers:** Mid-market companies (50–500 employees)  
**Primary Users:** Operations managers, team leads, and internal project owners  

FlowSync provides a workflow automation platform that allows companies to build internal processes, automate repetitive tasks, and track operational performance.

## Current Situation

FlowSync has experienced strong top-of-funnel growth through marketing campaigns and free trial signups. However, internal metrics show that:

- A large percentage of users sign up but fail to complete initial setup.
- Time-to-first-value is longer than expected.
- Customer support tickets during onboarding are high.
- Trial-to-paid conversion rates have plateaued.

The product team suspects friction in the onboarding and activation journey but lacks clarity on where users are dropping off and why.

---

## Core Business Problem

FlowSync is investing heavily in customer acquisition, but activation and conversion are underperforming.

This creates:

- Lost potential revenue from trial users who never convert
- High support costs during onboarding
- Increased churn within the first 90 days
- Pressure from leadership to demonstrate measurable UX improvements

---

## Strategic Goals

The leadership team wants to:

1. Increase activation rate (users completing initial workflow setup).
2. Improve trial-to-paid conversion.
3. Reduce onboarding-related support tickets.
4. Deliver measurable improvements within 6–12 weeks.
5. Justify ROI before committing additional engineering resources.

---

## Constraints

- Engineering bandwidth is limited.
- Any solution must integrate with existing analytics tooling.
- Security and data privacy are important for enterprise customers.
- Leadership requires measurable outcomes tied to revenue impact.

---

## Stakeholders

- Head of Product
- VP of Revenue
- Support Team Lead
- Engineering Manager
- CFO (interested in ROI justification)

---

## Opportunity

If onboarding friction is reduced and activation improves, FlowSync could:

- Increase revenue without increasing marketing spend
- Improve customer retention
- Reduce support costs
- Strengthen competitive positioning in the mid-market SaaS space
