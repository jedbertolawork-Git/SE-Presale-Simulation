# 04 — ROI Model & Business Case

## Objective

To quantify the financial impact of improving onboarding activation and reducing support friction at FlowSync.

This model uses conservative assumptions based on typical mid-market SaaS metrics.

---

## Current Baseline Assumptions

Monthly Trial Signups: 2,000  
Activation Rate: 40%  
Trial-to-Paid Conversion: 20%  
Average Revenue Per Customer (ARPA): £150/month  
Onboarding-Related Support Tickets: 600/month  
Estimated Cost Per Support Ticket: £18  

---

## Current Revenue Calculation

2,000 signups × 40% activation = 800 activated users  

800 activated × 20% conversion = 160 paying customers  

160 customers × £150/month = **£24,000 new Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**  

---

## Scenario: Conservative Improvement Case

Assume:

Activation increases from 40% → 50%  
Conversion increases from 20% → 23%  

### New Revenue Calculation

2,000 signups × 50% activation = 1,000 activated users  

1,000 activated × 23% conversion = 230 paying customers  

230 customers × £150/month = **£34,500 new MRR**

---

## Monthly Revenue Uplift

£34,500 − £24,000 = **£10,500 additional MRR**

Annualised Impact:

£10,500 × 12 = **£126,000 additional annual recurring revenue**

---

## Support Cost Reduction

If onboarding improvements reduce tickets by 20%:

600 tickets/month × 20% = 120 fewer tickets  

120 tickets × £18 = **£2,160 monthly savings**

Annualised savings:

£2,160 × 12 = **£25,920 annual cost reduction**

---

## Total Annual Financial Impact

Additional Revenue: £126,000  
Support Savings: £25,920  

**Total Potential Annual Impact: £151,920**

---

## Estimated Implementation Cost

Assume:

2 frontend engineers (part-time for 8 weeks)  
1 product manager oversight  
Minimal tooling costs  

Estimated internal cost: ~£45,000

---

## ROI Summary

Total Annual Impact: £151,920  
Estimated Cost: £45,000  

Projected Net Gain: £106,920  

Payback Period: ~4 months

## Executive Takeaway

Improving onboarding activation presents a high-leverage opportunity:

- Generates revenue without increasing marketing spend  
- Reduces operational costs  
- Improves customer retention  
- Creates a repeatable experimentation framework
