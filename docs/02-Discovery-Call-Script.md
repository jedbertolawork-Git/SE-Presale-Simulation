# 02 — Discovery Call Script

## Objective of the Call

To understand FlowSync’s onboarding challenges, quantify business impact, identify technical constraints, and define success criteria for a potential engagement.

---

## 1. Opening & Agenda (2–3 Minutes)

“Thanks for the time today. The goal of this session is to better understand your onboarding challenges, what impact they’re having on the business, and what success would look like if we solved them.

I’ll ask a mix of product, operational, and technical questions. At the end, I’ll summarise what I’ve heard and outline potential next steps. Does that sound good?”

---

## 2. Current State Exploration

### Product & User Journey

- Can you walk me through the current onboarding experience from signup to first successful workflow?
- What does a “successful activation” look like internally?
- Where do you believe users struggle most?
- How long does it typically take a user to reach first value?

### Metrics & Visibility

- What is your current activation rate?
- What is your trial-to-paid conversion rate?
- Do you track onboarding drop-off points?
- What analytics tools are currently implemented?

---

## 3. Pain & Business Impact

- What happens when users fail to activate?
- How does this impact revenue targets?
- How many onboarding-related support tickets do you receive monthly?
- What is the estimated cost per support ticket?
- Are churned customers citing onboarding complexity as a reason?

Goal: Quantify financial and operational impact.

---

## 4. Technical Environment

- What analytics or tracking tools are currently integrated?
- Are there constraints around adding new instrumentation?
- How is your experimentation (A/B testing) currently handled?
- What level of engineering bandwidth is realistically available?

---

## 5. Stakeholders & Decision Process

- Who ultimately signs off on this type of initiative?
- Is budget already allocated for UX or activation improvements?
- What timeline are you working toward?
- What internal risks or objections might we face?

---

## 6. Success Criteria Definition

“If we were successful six months from now, what would need to be true?”

- Target activation rate?
- Target reduction in support tickets?
- Revenue impact expectations?
- Timeline for measurable results?

---

## 7. Close & Next Steps

“Based on what I’ve heard today, it sounds like onboarding friction is directly affecting activation, conversion, and support costs.

As a next step, I’d propose summarising these findings into a structured solution outline with projected business impact. Would that align with your expectations?”
