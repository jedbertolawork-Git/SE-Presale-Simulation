# Solutions Engineer Pre-Sales Simulation

A structured pre-sales case study demonstrating how I would approach discovery, solution design, ROI modelling, and executive-level demo delivery as a Solutions Engineer.

This project simulates a real-world engagement with a mid-sized B2B SaaS company experiencing onboarding friction impacting activation, conversion, and revenue growth.

---

## Scenario Overview

**Client (Fictional):** FlowSync  
**Industry:** B2B SaaS – Workflow Automation  
**Primary Challenge:** Low activation and trial-to-paid conversion due to onboarding friction  

The objective was to:

- Diagnose onboarding drop-off
- Propose a phased, low-risk solution
- Quantify revenue impact
- Present improvements in an executive-ready format

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Structured discovery questioning
- Translating business pain into technical requirements
- Phased solution planning
- SaaS revenue modelling (MRR, conversion, support cost)
- ROI calculation and payback period analysis
- Executive demo storytelling
- Objection handling strategy

This reflects the core responsibilities of a Solutions Engineer working with product, revenue, and leadership stakeholders.

## Why I Built This

As a technical graduate transitioning into Solutions Engineering, I wanted to demonstrate not just technical ability, but the ability to:

- Align product improvements with revenue outcomes
- Communicate clearly with executive stakeholders
- Structure discovery around measurable impact
- Think commercially, not just technically

This repository represents how I would structure a real pre-sales engagement from initial discovery through to executive presentation.
